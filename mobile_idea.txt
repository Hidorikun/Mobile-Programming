I want a better application for Goodreads 

i want to be able to add the books i've read, 
to edit them, 
to delete them 
and to view them in as soon  as I enter the application. 

I also want to be able to track my time reading a book with a stopwatch I can start and stop 
as I like, and when I stop it I want to be able to update the page I've arrived to, and 
for it to be syncronized to the good reads app

I also want to be able to search for people on goodread and do all the stuff you can do 
in the normal site.
